this is a homework for the oden project 

I have this rough plan for now of how to od it which goes something like this  

1:Plan the general structure of the project, including HTML and CSS styling. ✅

2"Create a container div to hold all the grid parts. ✅

3:Prompt the user to enter a number for the grid size, but consider using set numbers to avoid errors. ✅

4:Square the user's input to determine the number of grid parts needed. ✅

5:Create the grid parts using the squared value as the total number. ✅

6:Since the container is a square, determine the correct alignment of the grid parts by calculating a value j that is 100 divided by the user's input. ✅

7:Use flexbox and wrap to align the grid parts properly in the container. ✅

8 : Added the options tap to the right of the grid which have the coloring modes a ersaer and a clearing button with a slider and a color input 

9 : change the color of the grids on click and the grid size with the slider insted of the prompt;
